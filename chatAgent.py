Let me start by looking through the content provided. \n\nFirst, I remember seeing a section about absentee codes. It lists two categories: those that count against exemptions and those that don't. The ones that don't count against exemptions are probably the excused ones. \n\nLooking at the codes that don't count against exemptions, they include Act (School Activity), Ofc (in office), Cns (with counselor), Nrs (with Nurse), Tch (with Teacher), Fnl (Absence for Funeral), BOT/PASS (In school Suspension), and Crt (Absence for Court). \n\nWait, but the user is asking about excused absences, not just those that don't count against exemptions. I should make sure these are the same thing. The handbook mentions exemptions, which I think are related to being excused from finals. So, these codes likely represent excused absences. \n\nAdditionally, there's a section about make-up work that says absences can be excused, and students have two days to make up work per day missed. It also mentions that excused absences include things like funerals and religious observances, as seen in points 5 and 6 of the context. \n\nSo, putting it all together, excused absences are those with the codes Act, Ofc, Cns, Nrs, Tch, Fnl, BOT/PASS, and Crt. Also, attending funerals or religious observances are excused. \n\nI should structure the answer to list these codes and their meanings, citing the relevant sections. Since the exact page number isn't clear, I'll mention the section on Absentee Codes and the make-up work section.\n</think>\n\nAccording to the Bartlesville High School handbook, excused absences are those that do not count against exemptions. These include:\n\n- Act: School Activity\n- Ofc: In office\n- Cns: With counselor\n- Nrs: With Nurse\n- Tch: With Teacher\n- Fnl: Absence for Funeral\n- BOT/PASS: In school Suspension\n- Crt: Absence for Court\n\nAdditionally, attending funerals or observing religious holidays are considered excused absences. \n\nThese details can be found in the sections on Absentee Codes and Make-Up Work for Absences. \n\nIf you need further clarification, please refer to the relevant sections or contact the school directly."
